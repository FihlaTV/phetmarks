Bookmark URLs for use in PhET development

This is meant to be checked out as a sibling repository to the other PhET repositories, so that the relative URL
bookmarks will work. No server is necessary to use this, and anyone can create their own bookmark files.

# Root directory

# launcher directory

Contains a phet-io style launcher of sims

# testmarks directory
